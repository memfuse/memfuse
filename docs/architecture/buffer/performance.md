## Performance Tuning Guide

### Configuration Optimization

#### Memory-Constrained Environments

**Problem**: Limited memory availability
**Solution**: Reduce buffer sizes and cache capacity

```yaml
buffer:
  enabled: true
  round_buffer:
    max_tokens: 400        # Reduced from 800
    max_size: 3            # Reduced from 5
  hybrid_buffer:
    max_size: 3            # Reduced from 5
  query:
    cache_size: 50         # Reduced from 100
    max_size: 10           # Reduced from 15
  performance:
    max_flush_workers: 2   # Reduced from 3
```

**Expected Impact** (To be verified through testing):
- Memory usage: Expected reduction
- Latency: May increase slightly
- Throughput: May decrease

#### High-Throughput Optimization

**Problem**: Need maximum throughput
**Solution**: Increase buffer sizes and worker counts

```yaml
buffer:
  enabled: true
  round_buffer:
    max_tokens: 1500       # Increased from 800
    max_size: 10           # Increased from 5
  hybrid_buffer:
    max_size: 10           # Increased from 5
  query:
    cache_size: 300        # Increased from 100
  performance:
    max_flush_workers: 6   # Increased from 3
    flush_strategy: "size_based"  # Optimize for throughput
```

**Expected Impact** (To be verified through testing):
- Throughput: Expected increase
- Memory usage: Expected increase
- Latency: May increase

#### Low-Latency Optimization

**Problem**: Minimize response time
**Solution**: Use bypass mode or reduce buffer sizes

```yaml
# Option 1: Complete bypass
buffer:
  enabled: false

# Option 2: Minimal buffering
buffer:
  enabled: true
  round_buffer:
    max_tokens: 200        # Very small batches
    max_size: 2
  hybrid_buffer:
    max_size: 2
  performance:
    flush_strategy: "time_based"  # Optimize for latency
```

**Expected Impact** (To be verified through testing):
- Latency: Expected significant reduction (bypass) or moderate reduction (minimal)
- Throughput: May decrease (bypass) or slight decrease (minimal)
- Memory usage: Expected significant reduction (bypass) or moderate reduction (minimal)

### Resource Allocation

#### CPU Optimization

**Worker Thread Allocation**:
```yaml
performance:
  max_flush_workers: <CPU_CORES>  # Match CPU cores
  enable_async_processing: true   # Enable async operations
```

**Guidelines**:
- **2-4 cores**: max_flush_workers = 2-3
- **4-8 cores**: max_flush_workers = 3-5
- **8+ cores**: max_flush_workers = 5-8

#### Memory Optimization

**Buffer Size Calculation Framework**:
```python
# Memory usage estimation formula (to be calibrated with actual data)
total_memory = (
    round_buffer_size * avg_message_size * max_size +
    hybrid_buffer_size * (avg_message_size + embedding_size) * max_size +
    query_cache_size * avg_result_size
)

# Example calculation framework (values TBD through testing)
# round_buffer: max_size rounds * avg_message_size * buffer_count
# hybrid_buffer: max_size rounds * (avg_message_size + embedding_size) * buffer_count
# query_cache: cache_size queries * avg_result_size
# Total: base_memory + overhead (to be measured)
```

### Bottleneck Identification

#### Common Bottlenecks

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph "Performance Bottlenecks"
        A[High Memory Usage] --> B[Reduce buffer sizes]
        C[High CPU Usage] --> D[Reduce worker count]
        E[High Latency] --> F[Enable bypass mode]
        G[Low Throughput] --> H[Increase buffer sizes]
        I[Low Cache Hit Rate] --> J[Increase cache size]
        K[Frequent Timeouts] --> L[Increase timeout values]
    end
```

#### Bottleneck Detection Framework

**Memory Bottleneck Indicators** (Thresholds to be determined):
- Memory usage exceeding available capacity
- Frequent garbage collection patterns
- Out of memory errors

**CPU Bottleneck Indicators** (Thresholds to be determined):
- Sustained high CPU usage
- High context switching rates

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Performance Issues

#### Issue 1: High Memory Usage

**Symptoms** (Specific thresholds to be determined):
- Memory usage exceeding expected limits
- Frequent garbage collection
- Out of memory errors

**Diagnosis**:
```python
# Check buffer statistics
stats = buffer_service.get_stats()
print(f"Round buffer size: {stats['round_buffer']['current_size']}")
print(f"Hybrid buffer size: {stats['hybrid_buffer']['current_size']}")
print(f"Query cache size: {stats['query_buffer']['cache_size']}")
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Reduce buffer sizes**:
   ```yaml
   round_buffer:
     max_size: 3  # Reduce from 5
   hybrid_buffer:
     max_size: 3  # Reduce from 5
   ```

2. **Clear caches periodically**:
   ```python
   # Manual cache clearing
   buffer_service.get_query_buffer().clear_cache()
   ```

3. **Enable bypass mode**:
   ```yaml
   buffer:
     enabled: false
   ```

#### Issue 2: High Latency

**Symptoms** (Specific thresholds to be determined):
- P95 latency exceeding acceptable limits
- User complaints about slow responses
- Timeout errors

**Diagnosis**:
```python
# Analyze latency breakdown
stats = buffer_service.get_stats()
print(f"Average write latency: {stats['performance']['avg_write_latency']}")
print(f"Average query latency: {stats['performance']['avg_query_latency']}")
print(f"Cache hit rate: {stats['query_buffer']['hit_rate']}")
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Enable bypass mode for low latency**:
   ```yaml
   buffer:
     enabled: false
   ```

2. **Reduce batch sizes**:
   ```yaml
   round_buffer:
     max_tokens: 400  # Reduce from 800
   ```

3. **Optimize cache settings**:
   ```yaml
   query:
     cache_size: 200  # Increase cache size
     similarity_threshold: 0.90  # Lower threshold for more hits
   ```

#### Issue 3: Low Throughput

**Symptoms** (Specific thresholds to be determined):
- Messages/minute below expected performance
- Worker pool underutilized
- Batch processing inefficient

**Diagnosis**:
```python
# Check throughput metrics
stats = buffer_service.get_stats()
print(f"Transfer rate: {stats['write_buffer']['transfer_rate']}")
print(f"Worker utilization: {stats['performance']['worker_utilization']}")
print(f"Batch efficiency: {stats['write_buffer']['avg_batch_size']}")
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Increase buffer sizes**:
   ```yaml
   round_buffer:
     max_tokens: 1200  # Increase from 800
     max_size: 8       # Increase from 5
   ```

2. **Add more workers**:
   ```yaml
   performance:
     max_flush_workers: 5  # Increase from 3
   ```

3. **Optimize flush strategy**:
   ```yaml
   performance:
     flush_strategy: "size_based"  # Optimize for throughput
   ```

### Diagnostic Tools

#### Performance Profiling

```python
# Built-in performance profiler
from memfuse_core.buffer.profiler import BufferProfiler

profiler = BufferProfiler(buffer_service)
profile_data = await profiler.profile_operations(duration=60)  # 1 minute

print("Performance Profile:")
print(f"Write operations: {profile_data['write_ops']}")
print(f"Query operations: {profile_data['query_ops']}")
print(f"Memory peaks: {profile_data['memory_peaks']}")
print(f"Bottlenecks: {profile_data['bottlenecks']}")
```

#### Memory Analysis

```python
# Memory usage analyzer
from memfuse_core.buffer.analyzer import MemoryAnalyzer

analyzer = MemoryAnalyzer(buffer_service)
memory_report = analyzer.analyze_memory_usage()

print("Memory Analysis:")
print(f"Component breakdown: {memory_report['components']}")
print(f"Memory leaks: {memory_report['potential_leaks']}")
print(f"Optimization suggestions: {memory_report['suggestions']}")
```

#### Load Testing

```python
# Built-in load testing utility
from memfuse_core.buffer.load_test import BufferLoadTester

load_tester = BufferLoadTester(buffer_service)
results = await load_tester.run_load_test(
    concurrent_users=10,
    duration=300,  # 5 minutes
    message_rate=100  # messages per minute per user
)

print("Load Test Results:")
print(f"Peak throughput: {results['peak_throughput']}")
print(f"Average latency: {results['avg_latency']}")
print(f"Error rate: {results['error_rate']}")
```
