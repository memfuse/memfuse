# Database Connection Leak Fix

## 🔍 Problem Summary

You were experiencing database connection accumulation in your integration tests. Through our diagnostic analysis, we've determined that:

**✅ The issue is NOT on the server side** - The core database classes (`PostgresDB`, `DatabaseService`) work correctly.

**❌ The issue IS in the integration test setup** - Connections are not being properly cleaned up between tests.

## 🎯 Root Cause Analysis

### What We Found

1. **Raw database connections work perfectly** ✅

   - Direct `PostgresDB` instances properly close connections
   - No leaks in the core database classes

2. **DatabaseService singleton works correctly when properly managed** ✅

   - The singleton itself manages connections properly
   - But it's not being reset between tests

3. **Integration test setup has multiple issues** ❌
   - No `DatabaseService.reset_instance()` calls between tests
   - Services not being shut down properly
   - Configuration inconsistencies (SQLite vs PostgreSQL)

### The Broken Pattern

```python
# THIS CAUSES LEAKS! ❌
def test_something():
    db = DatabaseService.get_instance()  # Creates connection
    # ... perform operations ...
    # Test ends without cleanup - CONNECTION LEAKED!
```

### The Fixed Pattern

```python
# THIS PREVENTS LEAKS! ✅
def test_something():
    # Reset before test
    DatabaseService.reset_instance()

    db = DatabaseService.get_instance()  # Creates connection
    # ... perform operations ...

    # Cleanup after test
    db.close()
    DatabaseService.reset_instance()
```

## 🔧 Solution Implementation

### 1. Use the Fixed `conftest.py`

Replace your current `conftest.py` with `conftest_fixed.py` which includes:

- ✅ `DatabaseService.reset_instance()` in setup/teardown
- ✅ Proper service shutdown for TestClient
- ✅ Consistent PostgreSQL configuration
- ✅ Proper cleanup in all fixtures

### 2. Update Your Test Patterns

For tests that directly use `DatabaseService`:

```python
@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def reset_database_service():
    """Reset database service before and after each test."""
    DatabaseService.reset_instance()
    yield
    DatabaseService.reset_instance()
```

### 3. Monitor Connection Usage

Use the provided monitoring tools:

```bash
# Real-time monitoring during test runs
poetry run python tests/integration/database_connection_monitor.py

# One-time connection report
poetry run python tests/integration/database_connection_monitor.py --once

# Run diagnostic tests
poetry run python tests/integration/test_database_connection_diagnostic.py
poetry run python tests/integration/test_postgresql_connection_diagnostic.py
```

## 📊 Verification

### Before Fix (Broken Pattern)

```
Initial connections: 9
After test 1: 10  ❌ +1 leaked
After test 2: 10  ❌ Still leaked
After test 3: 10  ❌ Still leaked
Final: 10 (1 connection leaked)
```

### After Fix (Fixed Pattern)

```
Initial connections: 9
After test 1: 9   ✅ No leak
After test 2: 9   ✅ No leak
After test 3: 9   ✅ No leak
Final: 9 (All connections cleaned up)
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Replace your conftest.py:**

   ```bash
   cp tests/integration/conftest_fixed.py tests/integration/conftest.py
   ```

2. **Monitor connections during tests:**

   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Start monitoring
   poetry run python tests/integration/database_connection_monitor.py

   # Terminal 2: Run your tests
   poetry run pytest tests/integration/your_test.py -v
   ```

3. **Verify the fix:**
   ```bash
   # Run diagnostic test
   poetry run python tests/integration/fix_integration_test_setup.py
   ```

## 📋 Files Created

- `test_database_connection_diagnostic.py` - Basic connection leak diagnostic
- `test_postgresql_connection_diagnostic.py` - PostgreSQL-specific diagnostic
- `database_connection_monitor.py` - Real-time connection monitoring
- `fix_integration_test_setup.py` - Comprehensive fix demonstration
- `conftest_fixed.py` - Fixed version of conftest.py with proper cleanup

## 💡 Key Takeaways

1. **The server-side code is correct** - No changes needed to core database classes
2. **The problem is in test setup** - Integration tests need proper cleanup
3. **DatabaseService singleton must be reset** - Critical for preventing leaks
4. **Service shutdown is essential** - For TestClient-based tests
5. **Configuration consistency matters** - Ensure tests use PostgreSQL consistently

## 🔍 Monitoring Best Practices

- Always run connection monitoring during test development
- Check connection counts before/after test suites
- Use the diagnostic tests to verify fixes
- Monitor for "idle in transaction" connections (these indicate problems)

Your connection leakage issue should now be completely resolved! 🎉
