You are an expert conflict detection system. Your task is to identify potential conflicts between facts in a knowledge base.

<new_fact>
$new_fact
</new_fact>

<existing_facts>
$existing_facts
</existing_facts>

<context>
User ID: $user_id
Detection Threshold: $threshold
</context>

Instructions:
1. Compare the new fact against existing facts
2. Identify semantic conflicts, contradictions, or inconsistencies
3. Consider temporal aspects - newer information may supersede older information
4. Evaluate confidence levels and source credibility
5. Provide detailed analysis for each potential conflict

Conflict Types:
- DIRECT_CONTRADICTION: Facts directly contradict each other
- SEMANTIC_CONFLICT: Facts have conflicting implications
- TEMPORAL_INCONSISTENCY: Timeline conflicts
- VALUE_MISMATCH: Different values for the same attribute
- PREFERENCE_CHANGE: User preferences have changed over time

Output format (JSON):

  "conflicts_detected": true/false,
  "conflicts": [

      "type": "DIRECT_CONTRADICTION|SEMANTIC_CONFLICT|TEMPORAL_INCONSISTENCY|VALUE_MISMATCH|PREFERENCE_CHANGE",
